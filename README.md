# qnx-fun

## Brief
Create a launcher in HTML that appears like the one in QNX RTOS 6

## Description
Creates a customizable launcher that can be used via JavaScript. It looks like the launch bar used on the right hand side of this image. QNX has always
had a polished but nice look that is somewhat unique. It has always caught my attention. So here is a work in progress on how to make my early example
go. 

Look at the qnxfun.html to see how to use it for now.
